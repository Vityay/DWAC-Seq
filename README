DWAC-seq (ver. 0.56)

Dynamic Window Approach for CNV detection using sequencing tag density

Prerequisites:

-- samtools installed in a folder which is in the PATH variable.


Usage:

You need to aligned .bam files which are indexed (.bam.bai)

Command line:

dwac-seq.pl --test test_bam --ref ref_bam --chr chromosome_name
  (optional: --amb ambiguity --scale --no_fine_tuning)

It is not adviseable to specify optional parameters unless you know what you are doing)


The output will contain 4 files:
	- file with name ending with a chromosome name will contain the predicted copy number of regions
of the chromosome;
	- file with name ending with 'windows' contains the number of reads in test sequence for every window.
It can be subject for visualization (https://fedor21.hubrecht.eu/slavik/hilbert/).
